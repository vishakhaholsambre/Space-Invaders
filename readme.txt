Welcome To Space Invaders!

Enemies have entered our atmosphere, and it is your job to get rid of them before
they infiltrate Earth! The objective of this game is to destory all enemies before
they destroy you. Move your player side to side with the right and left arrow keys,
and shoot bullets at the enemies with the 'A' key. The enemies will also be shooting 
bullets at you, so you only have three lives to complete your mission. Press 'Select'
to begin, pause, and resume.

Remember to be quick! Good luck!
